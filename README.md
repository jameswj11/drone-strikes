# Drone Strikes

A Ruby on Rails application that parses US drone strike data and displays it visually. Data include date of strike, targets, region, number of people killed, number of civilians killed, and the names of those killed (if provided). Every strike includes a link to an investigative article by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
